# interval-trainer-js

A Simple tool to time my interval workouts at home. Written in good old fashioned vanilla javascript.
<br>

## background
Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, many other gym enthusiasts like myself have had to move their workouts to their home garages.
<br><br>
In the absence of access to larger dumbells and other freeweights, I decided I would increase the intensity of the workouts with time elapsed per exercise to make incremental progress rather than use incremental weight increase. Naturally I needed a tool for this job and figured anything available currently was overly complicated with too many options so my solution was to create my own.
<br><br>
Thought I'd share on here incase someone else needs something similar.


## usage

to use just open index.html in a web browser application (chrome preferred)
